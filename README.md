# Lights Manager

## Getting Started

Some packages used in this project such as `electron-webpack` and `electron-builder` strongly recommend the use of `yarn` for package management, so it is used rather than `npm`.

Clone the repo:

`git clone git@github.com:jgutschon/lights-manager.git`

Install yarn:

`npm i -g yarn`

Install the project dependencies:

`yarn`

## Available Scripts

Start the app locally for development:

`yarn dev`

Build a package from source (defaulted to deb):

`yarn build`
